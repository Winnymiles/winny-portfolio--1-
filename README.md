## Overview

This portfolio presents my background as an optical and embedded-systems engineer with hands-on experience designing, testing, and validating:

- Free-space optical communication systems  
- Optical link modeling under turbulence and attenuation  
- Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensing systems  
- Optical alignment, imaging systems, and photonic device testing  
- DSP pipelines for biomedical and optical signals  
- Embedded microcontroller-based sensor systems  
- Optical design and experimental characterization  

These experiences are supported by academic and research work documented in my CV (pages 1–3) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

The website is built with Next.js 15 and optimized for clarity, accessibility, and performance.
